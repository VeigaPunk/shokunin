# Kasegi round 57 cloud resumption, 2026-11-02

This new dispatch supplements the existing attempted round-57 prompt without rewriting it. No round-57 lane work or report exists at recovered lane HEAD eae1d614542e8d30d77e9f4e8b9dea6a11aad138. Previous terminal closure is round56. Source snapshots and failed history remain unchanged.

## Current host and scope
Fleet: /workspace/scratch/e2fdad13233f/shokunin-training/shokunin.
Lane: /workspace/scratch/e2fdad13233f/shokunin-training/lanes/kasegi.
Both use branch cloud-hyaku-20261102. Do not push or configure credentials. Use pathspec-limited Git commits with kasegi-shokunin / kasegi@shokunin.local identity. Parent performs authorized GitHub durability separately and must not claim a round fully durable remotely until verified. Never invoke old Windows helpers/paths or local OMP providers. No new or real-target security actions.

User approved cloud sequential specialist passes with a separate independent non-author reviewer, replacing unavailable eight-simultaneous-AgentSwarm requirement. This is an explicit host adaptation; do not claim parallel8 evidence. All other craft, evidence, before/after, negative-control, quality, source, append-only, rejection and review requirements remain. Parent is sole fleet integration writer. Author stages final report outside fleet root after its own commits; parent lands with lane attribution. No counter advances before non-author closure.

Storage gate must be freshly clean before author work. User authorizes stale recoverable cloud scratch cleanup, not unique source/evidence deletion. Keep bounded scratch and capture receipts in committed lane paths.

## Proposed substantive claim (prospective, not an admission)
Investigate and correct OSV affectedness semantics in existing corpus: explicit versions OR ranges, and fixed/last_affected exclusion scoped to an events array rather than entire record. Re-open official source, establish bounded supported version domain, freeze falsifiable predicates and independent expected fixture answers before scored implementation. Avoid claiming a general package/ecosystem vulnerability scanner. One depth capability claim may hold legacy numeric score while demonstrating new semantic discrimination. Do not add a second claim merely to increase output count. Mine own mistakes and record admit/reject decisions; independent reviewer will create additional cases. Preserve all historical prose and append named corrections across every affected mention.

The following existing round prompt is retained verbatim for its operative craft sections and history. Host-specific paths, old launch/commit helper and concurrency instructions are superseded only by the current host rules above. Re-read current PROTOCOL.md and PROTOCOL-APPENDIX.md before work; do not use the historical prompt to grandfather weaker rules.

You are the kasegi L1, round 57, of the shokunin hyaku (百) training campaign.
You are a fresh session dispatched by the campaign orchestrator — you author this round's work.
Return a compact final summary (verdicts + hashes + the one CLOSURE-PREP line); the artifacts
you wrote carry the detail.

## 0. Where things are on this host

- Fleet root (read-only for you): `C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/shokunin-clone/shokunin` — MISSION.md, AXES.md, LEARNING.md, CORPUS.md,
  PROTOCOL.md, your rendered prompt `.ufo/prompts/kasegi-round-57.md`.
- Your lane repo (you own it this round): `C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/fleet/kasegi-shokunin` (branch `master`).
- Fleet repo commits are made by the orchestrator. NEVER run a mutating git command in the
  fleet root. In your lane repo, commit only through the plumbing helper (below) — the git
  index on this host is unreliable (NTFS-uncheckoutable paths) — then push:
  `python "C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/campaign/treecommit.py" --repo "C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/fleet/kasegi-shokunin" --branch master --name kasegi-shokunin --email kasegi@shokunin.local --message "<subject>" --push origin -- <path1> <path2> …`
  It prints the new commit sha. Verify landings with `git -C "C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/fleet/kasegi-shokunin" diff <base>..<new> --stat`
  and `git -C "C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/fleet/kasegi-shokunin" show <new>:<path>` — NEVER `git status` (garbage on this host),
  never `git add -A`/`commit -a`/`checkout .`/`stash`/`read-tree` (full-tree ops die or destroy).
- Scratch: `C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/scratch/kasegi-r57` — create it, use it for any clone/fixture/counter output, delete it
  before you finish. `/tmp` exists on this host but is never citable evidence; commit receipts
  into the lane repo (`.ufo/waves/round-57/…`) instead.
- Do not `cd` into the fleet root to run things that write; sources-census runs read-only:
  `bash "C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/shokunin-clone/shokunin/scripts/sources-census.sh" validate --root "C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/shokunin-clone/shokunin" kasegi` (exit 0 required at round end).

## 1. MISSION / AXES binding (SSOT)

Read MISSION.md + AXES.md at `C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/shokunin-clone/shokunin` first — they are the mission single source of
truth. Your lane axes: depth + coverage (bounty and security research). Where this prompt conflicts with MISSION.md + AXES.md, the
mission files win. Also read your lane's SKILL.md, PROVINCE.md, corpus/QUALITY.md, and your
last round lesson before declaring anything.

## 2. Claims this round — 1 to 3, each falsifiable

1. Open your lane repo's SCORECARD.md.
2. Declare 1–3 claims. Each claim is one axis-move against a distinct axis, with its own
   falsifiable before→after. At least one claim works the lowest-scoring non-retired axis —
   unless the stagnation nudge waives it (AXES.md).
3. Land every claimed improvement. Claims must be causally separable: each verifiable without
   the others having landed. Two claims on one axis = one claim.
4. Measure each: run a counting command you can paste into the report, before and after.
   Prefer counting commands that run on THIS host against committed bytes (grep -c / wc -l /
   ls | wc / bash corpus/<probe>.sh / git rev-parse). A command that only exists on the old
   Linux host is not a measurement here — adapt it or pick a different claim.
5. Record per claim in SCORECARD.md: the score delta, evidence pointer, counting command, and
   measured commit; append the motivating evidence to LOG.md.
6. A claim may be a capability acquisition: the new capability runs, its output verifies, and
   its row enters the SCORECARD capabilities table in the same round.
7. At most one claim may be exploratory (taste-bound, no counting command): it verifies only
   as `unprovable-but-better` with a named non-author reviewer on record; otherwise it lands
   `unprovable` and the round reports that honestly.

**Admission:** every claim verifies — measured, or exploratory with a named non-author
`unprovable-but-better` judgment — and **no axis is harmed**; a trade anywhere is not an
improvement. Report all verdicts honestly; the non-author closure judge re-derives everything.

## 2b. Frontier step — mandatory

1. Curate `corpus/SOURCES.md` (contract v1, CORPUS.md). A row is written only after its
   source is opened this round; the lesson's `## Gate` records URL/path/command, access date,
   ≤25-word located quote. Rejections stay as rows with reason and flip.
2. Record the census before→after: run the validate command above at round start and round
   end; paste both outputs and exit codes. Exit 0 required at round end.
3. Mine one mistake — this round or an earlier one — into
   `corpus/lessons/round-57.md` `## Mistakes`: class · evidence pointer · captured-by ·
   fix. Found none? Paste the sweep that found none.
4. At least one sourced claim: one claim rests on a `SOURCES.md` row opened this round (S###).

## 3. Helpers (optional, honest)

You may dispatch read-only subagents for parallel reconnaissance, but the craft, the commits,
and the verdicts are yours. Never pad. A round with one genuine verified claim beats three
inflated ones.

## 4. Report contract

Write the round report at `C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/shokunin-clone/shokunin/.ufo/reports/round-57/kasegi.md` (create
dirs; do NOT commit it — the orchestrator commits it). Required sections, in order:
- **Work performed** — names the declared claims (1–3) + target axes; one bullet per work
  item, each with an evidence pointer.
- **Landed changes** — every change tied to a LOG.md entry and its commit hash.
- **Before → after measurements** — one per claim, counting command + measured commit.
- **Sources & frontier** — SOURCES.md rows before→after with the counting command; or a line
  beginning `SOURCES: unchanged —` naming why (a real why, not laziness — you must still do
  2b's mistake-mining and census).
- **Trend verdicts** — one each for expansion, quality, discernment
  (improved|harmed|unchanged|unprovable-but-better), with evidence; no scalar.
- **SHONEN** — one line per box of your SHONEN.md checklist if your lane still has one:
  `[x]` only with a named non-author verifier, `[~]` with a resolvable evidence pointer,
  `[ ]` if untouched. No SHONEN.md → write `SHONEN: none (promoted lane)`.

Marker rule: a contentless report counts the round failed.

## 5. Commit, push scope, L0, §9 sizing, §10 assimilation

- Commit your lane work with the helper (only paths you changed), push origin master.
  Then write the report file. Cite only shas the helper printed.
- Push scope: your own lane remote only. Domain source trees are read-only.
- L0 side channel: operator decisions you need go to
  `C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/shokunin-clone/shokunin/.ufo/l0-questions.md` as `<lane> | round-<N> | <question>` — append-only,
  never blocking; route around open questions, never treat them as answered.
- §9 claim sizing: every target must be one a do-nothing control cannot reach. If the round
  is a fresh-start round (your prompt says FRESH-START), first read your last three rejected
  closures (MANIFEST + reports), spot-check them first, and declare only claims that clear
  that bar; say in the report what you ruled out and why.
- §10 assimilation: check `C:/Users/jpvei/.zcode/workspace/95b1ba4d-5089-47a4-9fd8-54adebbce2ae/fleet/kasegi-shokunin/considerthese/` (operator-authored input — mine it,
  never edit it; at most ONE still-unimplemented proposal per round, grounded through your
  own bar; no such dir → one report line says so). The shokuknow register is not reachable
  from this host: end the report's assimilation line with `Assimilation: none — shokuknow
  unreachable` when you adopted nothing.

## 6. Honesty rules (hard)

- Never fabricate a measurement, quote, source row, or sha. An honest `rejected-honest-stop`
  round is a valid outcome; a fabricated admitted round is the only unforgivable one.
- No secret values in anything you write (paths and shapes yes, material no).
- Absent surfaces: if your province names a surface that does not exist on this host, correct
  PROVINCE.md to the real path (or record it absent with date) and log the correction — that
  is protocol work, not a failure.
- Finish by deleting your scratch dir. Final line of your reply:
  `ROUND kasegi r57 done lane_head=<sha> pushed=<yes|no> claims=<n> admitted_self=<true|false>`
